1. Based on my first scatter plot, it is easy to see that as we move further away from Latitude=0, the temperature is decreasing. 

2. In plotting the northern hemisphere temperatures on the scatter plot, again it is easy to see that as latitude is increasing, the temperatures are decreasing. There is a strong correlation between the maximum temperature of a city and the latitude of a city as evidenced by an r-value of -0.865.

3. The cloudiness, humidity, and wind speeds of cities does not appear to have a strong relationship with the latitude of a city. This is shown by all of the weak r-values given in the scatter plots.
